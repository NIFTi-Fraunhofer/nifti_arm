1. Configuring
	edit "Config" to enable your CPC interface
	and configure the path to your kernel-sources
	or header files (e.g. /lib/modules/2.6.9/build)

2. Installing the driver:

-> on top level type:
	make clean install

	This will compile and install the configured
	drivers. To load the driver, type:
		insmod <DRIVER_DIR>/<DRIVER_NAME>.ko
		or
		modprobe <DRIVER_NAME>

-> for using cpcconf.ini
	look in tools/README for further information

-> if your distribution don't support udev, do
	make inodes 
   to create all needed device files

3. Making the demo application:

-> on top level type:
	make demo

4. To install the manual page for the library

-> on top level type:
	make doc

NOTE: For CPC-Card users
Please look into the README file in the cpc-card directory

NOTE: CPC-Class
The CPC-Class is not used by any driver, except the CPC-Card,
to register a device file for every new detected channel.
Due to the fact, that the CPC-Card cannot be offered any more,
the CPC-Class has been removed from the source code tree.
