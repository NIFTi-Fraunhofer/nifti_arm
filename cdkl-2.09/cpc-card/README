For using CPC-Card you need the following:

- make sure you have installed the driver before continue, see README in root directory of CDKL

- make also sure your PCMCIA subsystem (CardManager) is installed and working properly. 

  NOTE:
  If you are using an more up to date Linux distribution e.g. Fedora Core 4, SuSE 10.0, you
  don't need to install the PCMCIA CardManager software, cause it is handled by the kernels
  sysfs/hotplug interface. The driver modules are also automatically loaded by the kernel.

- you have to edit the PCMCIA configuration file in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts

- Add the following lines:

# EMS Dr. Thomas Wuensche CPC-Card CAN Interface
device "cpc-card_cs"
  card "EMS Dr. Thomas Wuensche CPC-Card CAN Interface"
  version "EMS_T_W", "CPC-Card", "*", "*"
  bind "cpc-card_cs"

- to load the driver, type "modprobe cpc-card_cs"

- restart the PCMCIA services
  SuSE:
  	rcpcmcia restart
  Debian:
  	/etc/init.d/pcmcia restart

- disconnect and reconnect CPC-CARD
  
  - you should hear 2 sounds
  - depending on your distribution you should see the device files 
    /dev/cpc_card0 and /dev/cpc_card1

- for testing you can use the "cpctool" demo application
  "cpctool -b<MyBaudrate> -i/dev/cpc_card0"

- if something goes wrong, look into /var/log/messages. There must be some 
  debugging messages

- on a desktop PC with a plug-in cardbus adapter (Ricoh host controller) it was needed to
  set "PCMCIA_PCIC_OPTS=irq_mode=0" (Using Yast (Yast1) with a SuSE distribution).
